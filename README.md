To trigger the camera as the nozzle passes over the vision area, your motion controller (e.g., Duet, Smoothieboard, or custom firmware) must:
Know the exact position of the nozzle.
Send a trigger pulse when the nozzle is centered over the camera FOV.
Optionally, queue the trigger slightly ahead to compensate for latency.
Example (pseudo-code):
if (motor->within_trigger_area()) {
    if (!trig_condition) {
        pull_camera_trig(); // Send 1.8V pulse
        trig_condition = true;
    }
}

This logic can be added to the stepper interrupt loop or motion planner in your firmware.
✅ 3. OpenPnP Software Integration
OpenPnP does not yet natively support on-the-fly vision, but you can prototype it with the following steps:
🔧 Step-by-Step Integration Plan:
Disable Bottom Vision Settling
In OpenPnP, disable the default bottom vision settling behavior to allow motion to continue.
Use External Trigger Mode
Configure the camera to only capture when triggered (via hardware trigger), not on a free-running stream.
Capture Image Asynchronously
After triggering, store the image in a buffer (possibly on a companion MCU like ESP32 or Raspberry Pi) and notify OpenPnP when ready.
Process Image in Parallel
While the head moves to the placement location, process the image in a background thread to extract part offset and rotation.
Apply Correction at Placement
Use the vision result to adjust the final placement coordinates.
🔍 Note: OpenPnP currently processes vision synchronously, so you'll need to modify the pipeline or offload processing to avoid blocking motion

| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1.8V logic level**    | Use optocoupler or level shifter                                        |
| **USB bandwidth**       | Triggered mode reduces unnecessary frames                               |
| **Image buffer**        | Use a companion board (ESP32, RP2040, or RPi) to grab and hold images   |
| **OpenPnP integration** | Requires custom code or plugin to handle async vision                   |
| **Lighting**            | Use **external strobe LED** synced with trigger for consistent exposure |

Summary
To implement on-the-fly vision with ELP-USBGS1200P02 and OpenPnP:
Use P02 variant with 1.8V hardware trigger.
Modify motion controller firmware to send trigger at nozzle position.
Use external MCU to buffer images and notify OpenPnP.
Modify OpenPnP to process vision asynchronously and apply corrections at placement.
This is a complex but achievable upgrade..... The OpenPnP community is actively exploring this, especially with global shutter cameras like the ELP P02.

OK = PC817 (or any 5 mA CTR ≥ 50 % opto)
R1 = 330 Ω (limits LED current @ 5 V to ≈ 10 mA)
R2 = 1 kΩ (pull-up to camera 1.8 V rail)
C1 = 100 nF (optional, debounce / 10 µs filter)
J1 = 2-pin header – controller side (“TRIG_IN”)
J2 = 2-pin header – camera side (SYNC & GND)

How it works
Idle: opto LED off → photo-transistor open → SYNC pulled to 1.8 V (camera idle).
Trigger pulse from controller (≥ 5 µs wide): LED turns on → transistor pulls SYNC to GND (active-low trigger).
Camera fires on falling edge of SYNC (1.8 V → 0 V).
Release controller pin → LED off → SYNC returns to 1.8 V → camera re-arms.

Board-level wiring for ELP-USBGS1200P02
The P02 variant brings the trigger out on a 5-pin JST-1.25 connector (bottom edge).
Pin-out (camera top-side silkscreen):
Table
Copy
Pin	Name	Wire colour (typ.)	Notes
1	GND	black	Common with USB shield
2	SYNC	white	Connect to “SYNC” node above
3	3.3 V	red	Ignore – this is an output from camera regulator
4	SDA	green	I²C for future use, leave open
5	SCL	yellow	I²C for future use, leave open
Only pins 1 & 2 are used for triggering.
Quick smoke test
Load v4l2-ctl --list-ctrls – confirm trigger_mode exists.
Set camera to external trigger:
v4l2-ctl -c trigger_mode=1
Toggle controller pin – you should see one frame appear in cheese / ffplay each time.
If you prefer a single-chip solution, replace the opto with a SN74LVC1T45 level-shifter powered from 1.8 V on the camera side; the wiring is identical, 
but the above schematic keeps you safe even if you accidentally short 24 V into the trigger line.
